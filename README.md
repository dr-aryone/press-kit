# Samantha Ming's Presentation Slide

There's not much value in the slides, it's all in the talk! Oops, I mean slide - no 's'. Yes, this is your 1-slide presentation. It's just me dropping my truth and sharing my thoughts 💪

## Invite Me To Speak 👩🏻‍🏫

I love sharing what I've learned. I've spoken at high schools, colleges, and tech companies. From my experience on how I grew my personal brand to 20k+ within a year OR how I switched careers into tech without a CS degree OR how kindness have made me more successful. My goal is to bring value, motivate action, and inspire kindness in your audience.
